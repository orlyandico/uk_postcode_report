# UK Postcode Report

Python script that scrapes postcode and housing data from Streetcheck.co.uk and generates a summary using Amazon Bedrock. Very handy to get a quick understanding of a particular post code (e.g. if you are considering renting or buying a house in that postcode).

Uses Amazon Bedrock, hard-coded pricing and model ID's for Claude Sonnet 3.5 v2 and Amazon Nova Pro 1.0

(Spoiler: for this use case, which is essentially summarisation, Nova Pro does an equivalent job to Claude at 1/3.75 of the cost)
